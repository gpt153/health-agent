## Project Overview

No description available.

## Development Workflow

This project is configured with the Remote Coding Agent and includes:
- **Archon MCP** - Task management and project tracking
- **exp-piv-loop Commands** - Proven development workflows from Cole Medin

### Available Commands

- `/plan <feature>` - Deep implementation planning with codebase analysis
- `/implement <plan-file>` - Execute implementation plans
- `/commit [target]` - Quick commits with natural language targeting
- `/create-pr [base]` - Create pull request from current branch
- `/review-pr <pr-number>` - Comprehensive PR code review
- `/merge-pr [pr-number]` - Merge PR after validation
- `/rca <issue>` - Root cause analysis for bugs
- `/fix-rca <rca-file>` - Implement fixes from RCA report
- `/prd [filename]` - Create Product Requirements Document
- `/worktree <branch>` - Create git worktrees for parallel development
- `/changelog-entry <description>` - Add CHANGELOG entry
- `/changelog-release [version]` - Promote changelog to release
- `/release <version>` - Create GitHub release with tag

### Using Archon

Task management is handled by Archon MCP. Common operations:

```bash
# List all tasks
list_tasks()

# Search tasks
list_tasks(query="authentication")

# Create task
manage_task("create", project_id="...", title="Fix bug", description="...")

# Update task status
manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="doing")

# Get project info
list_projects(project_id="...")
```

## 🎯 Autonomous Supervision System

**WHEN TO USE:** Managing entire projects or complex multi-issue features autonomously.

**Commands:**
- `/prime-supervisor` - Load project context and initialize supervisor role
- `/supervise` - Supervise entire project (all issues, dependencies, parallel work)
- `/supervise-issue N` - Supervise single GitHub issue to completion

**What it does:**
- Decomposes complex features into manageable issues
- Spawns monitoring subagents (max 5 concurrent) to track SCAR progress
- Manages dependencies automatically (sequential vs parallel execution)
- Verifies implementations via `/verify-scar-phase`
- Provides strategic updates (NO CODE - user cannot code)
- Handles context handoff seamlessly when limits approach

**Working directory:** Run from **project workspace**.

**Key principles:**
- Use subagents extensively to minimize supervisor context usage
- First principles thinking - challenge assumptions, provide cost-benefit analysis
- Strategic communication only - links, lists, comparisons (NO code examples to user)
- Brutal honesty about effort vs value
